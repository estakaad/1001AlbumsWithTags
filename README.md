# 1001AlbumsWithTags

The goal was to take all the albums from the list "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die" and add most common tags to them, so you'd know that this strange and unknown album you're planning to listen to will not be something you currently don't fancy listening.

There are some problems with getting the correct response from last.fm if the artist name or the title of the album contain special characters, I might fix that someday, but then again I might not. There's a lot to listen to even without it.
